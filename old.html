             who grants his son's request.<span class="first-span"> This son, however, is prodigal (i.e., wasteful and extravagant),</span>
             thus squandering his fortune and eventually becoming destitute. <span> As consequence, he now must return home
             empty-handed and intend to beg his father to accept him back as a servant.</span> To the son's surprise,
             he is not scorned by his father but is welcomed back with celebration and a welcoming party.
             Envious, the older son refuses to participate in the festivities. <span> The father tells the older son: 
             "you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours, but thy younger brother was lost and now he is found."</span>

           The Prodigal Son is the third and final parable of a cycle on redemption, following the that of the Lost Sheep and of the Lost Coin. In Revised Common Lectionary and Roman Rite Catholic Lectionary, this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of Lent (in Year C);[3] in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the Sunday of the Prodigal Son.
